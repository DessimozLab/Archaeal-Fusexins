# Data in this directory
This directory allocates data regarding the phylogenetic tree of Fsx1 and HAP2/GCS1 (i.e. Supplementary Figure 10 of the paper).
The files are:

- _**fsx1_hap2_selected.139.fasta**_: Set of employed sequences.
- _**fsx1_hap2_selected.139.einsi.fasta**_: Multiple sequence alignment, running MAFFT under E-INS-I modality.
- _**fsx1_hap2.figtree.unrooted_cand_9.nwk**_: Inferred phylogenetic tree (i.e. tree displayed in Supplementary Figure 10).
