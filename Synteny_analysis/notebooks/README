Brief description of notebooks present in this folder:


homolog_groups_inferences.ipynb
-------------------------------
Notebook containing pipeline for homolog group inferences for genes present in archaeal mobile elements containing FsxA. Full pipeline is described in Supplementary Materials of this manuscript, as well as in this notebook.
The pipeline also uses the script 'getting_orfs.py' and the notebook 'parsing_orf_homolog_groups.ipynb'.

ME_jaccard_index.ipynb
----------------------
Clustering of IMEs based on their gene content, by means of computing a Jaccard index based on the homolog group members present in this IMEs.


plotting_ME_synteny_complete_cluster.ipynb
------------------------------------------
Plotting IME synteny for one of the clusters observed in the plots generated by the notebook 'ME_jaccard_index.ipynb'.
It produces the base plot employed to obtain 'Supplementary Figure S9'


plotting_ME_synteny_complete_subset.ipynb
-----------------------------------------
Plotting a subset of IMEs of the cluster observed at 'Supplementary Figure S9'.
It produces the base plot employed to obtain 'Figure 4b', by coloring selected homolog groups on IMEs
