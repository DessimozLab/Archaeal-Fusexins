# data related to a simple strategy to define homolog sets in a _crafty_ way.
i. fsxA_psiblast3.faa = FASTA of sequences obtained at third iteration of PSIBLAST with one FsxA as query (from Natrinema altunense), and filtering with at least 1e-05 evalue and at least 70% coverage
ii. FsxA_PSIBLAST_3iter.msa = alignment done with MAFFT (under L-INS-I algorithm) of sequences catched in i.
